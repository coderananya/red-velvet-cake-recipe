"RECIPE OF MAKING RED VELVET CAKE"
"Red velvet cake is as striking visually as it is delicious. There's just something about that deep, red cake against the cream cheese frosting.


Mixing the baking soda with the vinegar is an interesting technique
 that you don't see very often in cakes, but its purpose is to generate
  extra rising power. And you really need to make sure your baking soda is fresh.


In fact, our number-one tip for anyone baking a cake: Use fresh 
baking soda! If it's been more than six months since you bought the
 baking soda in your pantry, you should replace it. And if you don't know
  how long it's been, replace it anyway. Baking soda loses its potency quickly, and 
  your cake won't rise properly if it's too old. (The same is true of baking powder,
     but this red velvet cake doesn't use any.)

Ingredients
2 1/2 cups/250 grams cake flour
3 tablespoons cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
1/4 cup red food coloring
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon white vinegar (or cider vinegar)
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
Steps to Make It
Preheat your oven to 350 F.


Butter and flour two 9-inch cake pans. It can help to line the bottom with
 a circle of parchment paper cut to fit the pan.


In a large mixing bowl, stir together the flour, cocoa, and salt until blended.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the eggs,
 oil, sugar, vanilla and red food coloring. Beat on medium speed until fluffy.

Now add some of the dry ingredients to the egg-sugar mixture while the machine 
is running. When it's fully incorporated, add some of the buttermilk. Continue
 alternating adding the dry ingredients with the buttermilk until it's all
  incorporated and the batter is smooth, scraping down the side of the bowl as you go.

In a small bowl, mix together the vinegar and baking soda, and when it foams,
 mix it into your batter. You're going to want to move quickly, though. Mix it
  in just until it's combined, about ten seconds. Then pour the batter into your
   prepared pans and transfer them to the oven.

Bake for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out
 clean, or with a crumb or two attached. You can start testing after 28 minutes
  because it's better to check too soon than to overbake.

Cool the cakes for 10 minutes in the pans on a wire rack, then loosen the edges
 by running a knife along the sides, turn the cakes out onto the racks and cool 
 for at least another hour, and then refrigerate (wrapped in plastic) for at least
  an hour before frosting with this cream cheese frosting."
